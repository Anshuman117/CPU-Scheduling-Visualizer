# Welcome to CPU Scheduling Visualizer!

https://cpu-scheduler-visualizer.vercel.app  
**CPU Scheduling Visualizer** is a web application that helps you understand CPU scheduling algorithms through interactive visualizations.  
You can explore multiple scheduling algorithms, see how processes are executed in **real-time** with a histogram or Gantt chart, and view calculated performance metrics.

## The scheduling algorithms currently available are:

- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
- **Round Robin**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**

## Features

- Animated histogram and Gantt chart views  
- Interactive process management (add, edit, delete)  
- Automatic performance metrics: Average Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, Response Time  
- Cyberpunk-themed UI with responsive design  
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick control  

## Running locally
